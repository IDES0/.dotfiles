# macOS Dotfiles

Hey there! This is my personal MacOS configuration files focused on creating a minimal, functional, and aesthetically pleasing development environment.
As a previous linux/i3wm user I've been trying to get the best of both worlds and create a setup that feels natural and easy to use and that I can use for both work and personal projects.

## Features

- **Window Management**: Using [Aerospace](https://github.com/nikitabobko/aerospace) for tiling window management, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use. Different from other MacOS Apps, it doesn't use the builtin workspace system, it handles everything in the same workspace, allowing you to change between workspaces without having to disabling core system protections, like yabai does.
- **Terminal**: [WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/) configured for optimal development experience
- **Status Bar**: Custom [SketchyBar](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyBar) configuration using Lua, already integrated with Aerospace for dinamically loading workspaces and listen for events.
- **System Borders**: Enhanced window borders using [Borders](https://github.com/FelixKratz/borders)
- **Additional Tools**:
  - Raycast for app launching and workflows
  - Starship for shell customization
  - Neovim as the primary text editor
  - Various CLI utilities for enhanced productivity
