Hey there! This is my personal MacOS configuration files focused on creating a minimal, functional, and aesthetically pleasing development environment for both work and personal projects.

As a previous linux/i3wm user I've been trying to get the best of both worlds and create a setup that feels natural and easy to use, as of today the best option for this is using Aerospace + Borders + SketchyBar.

## Features

- **Window Management**: Using [Aerospace](https://github.com/nikitabobko/aerospace) for tiling window management, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use. Different from other MacOS Apps, it doesn't use the builtin OS workspace system, it handles everything in the same OS workspace, allowing you to change between workareas without having to disabling core system protections.
- **Terminal**: [WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/) configured for optimal development experience
- **Status Bar**: Custom [SketchyBar](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyBar) configuration using Lua, already integrated with Aerospace for dinamically loading workspaces and listen for events.
- **System Borders**: Enhanced window borders using [Borders](https://github.com/FelixKratz/borders)
- **Additional Tools**:
  - Raycast for app launching and workflows
  - Starship for shell customization
  - Neovim as the primary terminal text editor
  - Various CLI utilities for enhanced productivity
